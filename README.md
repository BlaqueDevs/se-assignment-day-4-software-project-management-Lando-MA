# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met? Timely delivery allows for the project team to stick within budget, maintains project integrity and enhances satisfaction of stakeholders. Project managers can set deadlines for different milestones which collectively will ensure the deadline is met.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?Effective cost control ensures that the project is implemented to the end  within the budget allocation. It ensures aspect like not spending on items that were not initally listed in the scope of the project. One can prevent budget over runs by defining the scope and the schedule of project and sticking to the same through out the course of the project cycle. 
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each? The agile methodology is a flexible methodology that allows for adaptation in the project cycle. great for collaboration and intergrating customer feedback. On the other hand, waterfall  methodology is linear and structured in a way that one phase folows after  aother in the order as pre planned. The main advantages of the agile method is it is flexible , involves the customer feedback leading to imporved satisfaction, and suppports team collaboration, however on the other hand the project cycle is less predictable and customer feedback can derail progress. Waterfall projects on the other hand have several advantages including they are easy to manage and have clear structure. However, this methodology makes it difficult to accomodate changes.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each? Agile may be useful in the creation of user applications. Due to the nature of this application there is a need to improve the application from time to time to ensure the users are satsfied with use. 
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards? Ensuring  you solve the problem identified in the initialisation stage, ensuring you meet the client needs , ensuring you work within the budget, mitigating risk and lastly ensuring scalability and modifiability of the projectto meet future needs. This can be done through quality assurance and quality control. 
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful? Defining the scope sets the boundaries of the project allowing for the developer to have a clear understand of what problems they seeks to solve. WBS  defines how the work is going to be done by who . This allows for accountability which eases collaboration. 
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process? A detailed project schedule breaks down the timeline with milestones outlining what needs to be done at the specific milestones. The Gantt chart is a tool that supports the implementation of the schedule.  
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience? i havent settled on a specific project but i am hoping to work on something that helps in women empowerment 
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution? helps the project team identify the goals , allows for them to conduct a feasiabilty study to identify the practicality of the implementation within the budget stipulation. Supports identification of the scope which supports budget planning. 
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out? women empoerment not figured out how still thinking 
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software? I think this is a niche that needs to be explored 
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development? things like the recent draw back on USAID can affect funding of such software developement.
